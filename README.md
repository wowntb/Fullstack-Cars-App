# Fullstack Cars App

My first web app built using both Express and React to create a full stack application. This app displays a list of cars from a backend server and allows the user on the frontend to perform CRUD operations on the cars.

## Instructions

1. Go to the backend directory with your CLI and run "npm start" to get the backend of the app running.
2. Go to the frontend directory with your CLI and run "npm start" as well to open and use the app in your browser.
